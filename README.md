# 412ProjectGrader
This project was built throughout IST 412. It allows a teacher to compile and test their students java source code and will determine how accurate the student's program output is to the teacher's expected output. This solution is fully automated and rapidly improves the grading processes for IST 140, IST 240, and IST 242.
